# Parallel Evolution

## Pill Category

Frameworks (.NET)

## Description

My target for this pill is to explain the `async-await` construct. I decided to do that by providing a short overview on the evolution of parallel execution of some code.

I will talk about:

- `Thread`
- `ThreadPool`
- `Task`
- `async-await`
